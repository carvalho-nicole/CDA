# Community Detection Analysis (CDA)

#The goal of this project was to run a CDA on a behavioral dataset in order to obtain groups of patients with similar profiles. This behavioral dataset consisted of cognitive data from 41 patients with post stroke aphasia. Then functional connectivity (FC) values would be correlated between groups. FC values came from resting state fMRI.
